                <p><strong>Khula</strong> is the most common form of wife-initiated divorce. Under the 2015 amendment
                    to the Family Courts Act, the husband's consent is not required. If the wife asserts before the judge
                    that she cannot live within the limits prescribed by Islamic law, the court is bound to dissolve the
                    union. <strong>Talaq</strong> requires the husband to send written notice to the Union Council
                    Chairman and the wife. A 90-day reconciliation period follows before the divorce becomes effective.

                <h2>What Are Your Rights Regarding Child Custody After Divorce?</h2>

                <p>Pakistani law provides robust protections for children in custody disputes. Under the Guardianship
                    and Wards Act 1890 and Islamic law principles, courts design custody arrangements that serve the
                    child's best interests while respecting parental rights.</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Mother's preference (hizanat):</strong> Under Islamic law, mothers have preferential
                        custody for boys until age 7 and girls until puberty. This is the starting point, not the final
                        determination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Child's welfare test:</strong> For children beyond the hizanat age, courts consider the
                        child's preference (especially for children aged 10+), each parent's financial capability, moral
                        character, and living environment stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Father's financial obligation:</strong> Regardless of who has custody, the father
                        remains financially responsible for children's food, education, healthcare, and clothing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visitation rights:</strong> The non-custodial parent receives court-ordered visitation.
                        Typical arrangements include alternate weekends, half of school holidays, and shared religious
                        celebrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> If the custodial parent obstructs court-ordered visitation, we file
                        contempt of court proceedings and execution applications to enforce compliance.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Under Pakistani law, a wife can obtain <a

                            husband's consent. The 2015 amendment strengthened this right. Even if the husband refuses to
                            appear in court, the judge proceeds ex-parte and dissolves the marriage.</p>

                        <h3>Who gets child custody after divorce?</h3>
                        <p>Mothers have preferential custody for boys until <strong>age 7</strong> and girls until
                            <strong>puberty</strong>. After these ages, courts apply the welfare-of-the-child test.
                            Fathers retain financial responsibility regardless. <strong>Visitation rights are always
                                preserved</strong> for the non-custodial parent.

                        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> The husband must provide maintenance during iddat (3 menstrual cycles
                            or 3 months). This includes housing, food, clothing, and medical expenses at the same
                            standard as during marriage. Family Courts enforce compliance through salary attachment.</p>
