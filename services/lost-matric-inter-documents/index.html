                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>Retrieving a lost matric or inter certificate in Karachi</strong>
                    requires fulfilling strict legal prerequisites before the educational boards will issue a duplicate.
                    MR Law Associates manages the complete recovery protocol for lost documents, including filing the
                    required police report (Roznamcha), publishing the loss in approved newspapers, drafting
                    magistrate-sworn affidavits, and navigating the application bureaucracy at the Board of Secondary
                    Education Karachi (BSEK) and the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (BIEK).</p>

                <p>Educational certificates are foundational identity and qualification documents. Whether you are
                    applying for a government job, seeking university admission, or structuring an immigration visa,
                    missing your original 10th (Matric) or 12th (Inter) grade certificates will immediately halt your
                    progress. The boards do not simply print a new copy upon request; they demand legal proof that the
                    document was genuinely lost to prevent identity fraud and academic misrepresentation.</p>

                <h2>What Are the Legal Prerequisites for a Duplicate Certificate?</h2>

                <p>Before submitting an application form to the educational board, three distinct legal actions must be
                    completed to prove the document was lost and to indemnify the board against misuse.</p>

                <div class="service-features">
                    <div class="feature-box reveal">
                        <h3>Police Report (FIR / Roznamcha)</h3>
                        <p>Filing a formal report at the <strong>police station</strong> in the jurisdiction where the
                            document was lost. The report must specifically detail which document was lost
                            (Matric/Inter), the passing year, roll number, and the applicant's name. The board requires
                            an attested copy of this report.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-box reveal">
                        <h3>Newspaper Publication</h3>
                        <p>Publishing a <strong>lost document notice</strong> in a daily newspaper approved by the board
                            (usually one Urdu and one English daily). The notice alerts the public that the original
                            document is voided and protects you if someone attempts to misuse your credentials.</p>

                            Commissioner. This sworn statement declares under penalty of perjury that the document was
                            genuinely lost, has not been pledged as a guarantee, and guarantees return of the original
                            if ever found.</p>

                        <p>Combining the police report, newspaper clipping, affidavit, CNIC copies, and paid fee
                            vouchers into a bound file and submitting it to the specific verification counter at
                            <strong>BSEK (Nazimabad) or BIEK (North Nazimabad)</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Which Educational Boards Do We Coordinate With?</h2>

                <p>Karachi features multiple educational jurisdictions, each with entirely distinct duplicate issuance
                    SOPs, fee structures, and application portals.</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>BSEK (Board of Secondary Education Karachi):</strong> Responsible for 9th and 10th grade
                        (Matriculation) certificates for Science and General groups in Karachi.</li>
                    <li><strong>BIEK (Board of Intermediate Education Karachi):</strong> Responsible for 11th and 12th
                        grade (Intermediate) certificates spanning Pre-Medical, Pre-Engineering, Commerce, and
                        Humanities.</li>
                    <li><strong>SBTTE (Sindh Board of Technical Education):</strong> Covers DAE (Diploma of Associate
                        Engineering) technical diplomas and vocational training certificates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Documents Do You Need to Start the Process?</h2>

                <p>Providing accurate legacy data minimizes board search times. If you have lost every single piece of
                    paper, the process requires an initial 'record search' phase.</p>

                <h2>What If You Need to Correct an Error on the Duplicate?</h2>

                <p>Often, individuals discover errors (name spelling, father's name, date of birth) on their original
                    certificates only after losing them. You cannot request a duplicate and a correction simultaneously.
                    The standard legal procedure dictates you must first obtain the duplicate bearing the existing
                    error, and subsequently initiate a formal correction procedure—often requiring a <a
                        href="/services/civil-suit/" style="color:var(--accent-gold-dark);">civil suit for
                        declaration</a> if changing the date of birth or parentage significantly.</p>

                <h2>Why Select MR Law Associates for Document Recovery?</h2>

                <p>Dealing with the Karachi educational boards requires immense patience and an understanding of
                    bureaucratic protocols. We remove the friction from the recovery cycle.</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Integrated legal handling:</strong> We do not just submit forms; we handle the police
                        FIR, coordinate the newspaper publication, and draft the magistrate affidavits using precise,
                        board-mandated language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid multiple rejections:</strong> Board clerks routinely reject submissions for minor
                        formatting issues on affidavits or incorrect fee vouchers. We ensure a perfect submission on the
                        first attempt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expedited pathways:</strong> We understand the exact internal routing required to push
                        urgent duplicate requests through the respective departments at BSEK and BIEK.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsequent attestation:</strong> If the retrieved document is intended for foreign use,
                        we transition immediately into handling the required <a
                            href="/services/karachi-board-certificates/">board verifications</a> and HEC/MOFA
                        attestations.</li>

                        <p>While not strictly mandatory, a lawyer efficiently executes the <strong>FIR, newspaper ad,
                                and magistrate affidavit</strong>, saving you weeks of navigating police stations and
                            confusing board requirements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> An officially issued duplicate from BSEK or BIEK carries the
                            <strong>exact same legal weight</strong> as the original and is completely authorized for
                            HEC attestation and immigration assessments.</p>
