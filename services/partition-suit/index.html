                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>A partition suit lawyer in Karachi</strong> represents co-owners and
                    legal heirs seeking court-ordered division of jointly held property. MR Law Associates, led by
                    Advocate Reema Jawed, files and defends partition suits before the Civil Courts and High Court of
                    Sindh under the Partition Act 1893 and the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. Our firm handles inherited
                    property division according to Islamic inheritance shares, resolves co-ownership disputes, and
                    obtains court-appointed commissions for property valuation and physical division.</p>

                <p>Property disputes between family members are among the most common civil matters in Karachi. When
                    siblings can't agree on dividing inherited land, when business partners want to split jointly
                    purchased property, or when one co-owner refuses to sell or share rental income, a partition suit
                    becomes the legal remedy. The court steps in to divide the property fairly or order its sale.</p>

                <h2>What Types of Partition Suits Does MR Law Associates Handle?</h2>

                <p>MR Law Associates handles all categories of partition litigation filed under the Partition Act 1893
                    and Order XX Rule 18 of the CPC in Karachi's courts. The firm represents plaintiffs seeking division
                    and defendants contesting partition claims across residential, commercial, and agricultural property
                    disputes.</p>

                        <h3>Inherited Property Partition</h3>
                        <p>Division of property left by a deceased family member among legal heirs. Shares are
                            determined under Islamic inheritance rules (Muslim Personal Law), where <strong>sons receive
                                double the share of daughters</strong>. The court appoints a commissioner to physically
                            divide or value the property if heirs cannot agree.</p>

                        <h3>Co-Ownership Partition</h3>

                            unrelated co-owners. <strong>Shares follow the purchase agreement or proportional financial
                                contribution.</strong> If no agreement exists, the court presumes equal shares under

                            a small shop, or an indivisible commercial unit), the court orders <strong>partition by
                                sale</strong>. The property is auctioned and sale proceeds distributed among co-owners
                            according to their legal shares.</p>

                            the court orders <strong>equitable distribution of past and future rental income</strong>.
                            This applies to commercial properties, rental apartments, and income-generating land held

                <h2>How Does the Partition Suit Process Work in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>The partition suit process in Karachi follows a structured legal procedure starting with a legal
                    notice and ending with court-ordered division or sale. The process is governed by the Partition Act
                    1893, Order XX Rule 18 of the CPC, and specific rules of the Sindh Civil Courts.</p>

                <ol style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2.2;">
                    <li><strong>Legal Notice:</strong> A formal demand letter is sent to all co-owners requesting
                        voluntary partition. This notice serves as pre-suit evidence showing the plaintiff attempted
                        amicable resolution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Filing the Plaint:</strong> Your partition suit lawyer drafts the plaint identifying all
                        co-owners, describing the property (with survey numbers, area, and boundaries), stating each
                        party's claimed share, and specifying the relief sought (physical division or sale).</li>
                    <li><strong>Court Summons:</strong> The Civil Court issues summons to all defendants (co-owners).
                        Each defendant has 30 days to file a written statement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preliminary Decree:</strong> The court determines shares and declares each co-owner's
                        legal entitlement. In inherited property cases, Islamic inheritance shares are calculated. This
                        preliminary decree establishes the right to partition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appointment of Commission:</strong> The court appoints a Local Commissioner (often a
                        surveyor or property valuator) to physically inspect the property, submit a valuation report,
                        and recommend whether physical division is feasible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Decree:</strong> Based on the commission's report, the court issues a final decree
                        either dividing the property physically (with metes and bounds) or ordering sale and
                        distribution of proceeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution:</strong> If any party refuses to comply with the decree, the court's
                        execution department enforces it through the local police and revenue authorities.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What Documents Are Required for a Partition Suit in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>A partition suit in Karachi requires documentation proving co-ownership, establishing each party's
                    share, and identifying the property to be divided. Your partition suit lawyer verifies all documents
                    before filing to prevent delays caused by incomplete records.</p>

                <h2>How Are Shares Calculated in Inherited Property Partition?</h2>

                <p>Shares in inherited property partition are determined by Islamic inheritance rules under the Muslim
                    Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1962 for Muslim families. Non-Muslim families follow the
                    Succession Act 1925. The calculation is based on the deceased's relationship to each heir, their
                    gender, and whether other categories of heirs exist.</p>

                <p>These calculations become complex when multiple categories of heirs exist simultaneously. Your
                    partition suit lawyer calculates exact shares based on the applicable law and the specific family
                    configuration. Errors in share calculation lead to prolonged litigation and appeal proceedings.</p>

                <h2>What Happens When Property Cannot Be Physically Divided?</h2>

                <p>When physical division of property is impractical or would destroy its value, the court orders
                    partition by sale under Section 2 of the Partition Act 1893. A single apartment, a small shop, or a
                    house that cannot be split into separate units falls into this category.</p>

                <p>The partition by sale process follows these steps:</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Commissioner's report:</strong> The court-appointed commissioner reports that physical
                        division is not feasible without significant loss of value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> The court directs a professional property valuation to determine
                        fair market value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right of first purchase:</strong> Co-owners get first right to buy out other co-owners'
                        shares at the appraised value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Court auction:</strong> If no co-owner exercises the buy-out right, the property is sold
                        through court auction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution of proceeds:</strong> Sale proceeds are distributed among co-owners
                        according to their decreed shares, minus court expenses and commission fees.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Co-owners who wish to retain the property should express their intent to purchase other shares early
                    in the proceedings. This often leads to faster resolution through negotiated buyouts instead of
                    public auction.</p>

                        <h3>How long does a partition suit take in Karachi?</h3>
                        <p>A partition suit typically takes <strong>2 to 7 years</strong> for final resolution. If all
                            parties agree on shares, a compromise decree can be obtained within months. Contested cases
                            with multiple heirs, complex valuations, and appeals take longer.</p>

                        <h3>Can inherited property be partitioned by court order?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Under the Partition Act 1893, any co-owner or legal heir can file a
                            partition suit to divide jointly held property. The court appoints a commissioner to
                            physically divide the property or orders sale if division is impractical.</p>

                        <h3>What is the limitation period for a partition suit?</h3>
                        <p>Partition suits have <strong>no strict limitation period</strong> because the right to
                            partition exists as long as co-ownership continues. If adverse possession claims are
                            involved, a 12-year limit may apply to the dispossessed co-owner's claim.</p>

                        <h3>What happens if one co-owner refuses to partition?</h3>
                        <p>The court proceeds regardless of refusal. The refusing party receives summons and time to
                            respond. If they still refuse, the court can proceed <strong>ex-parte</strong> (in their
                            absence) and issue a partition decree that binds all parties.</p>

                        <h3>How are shares determined in a partition suit?</h3>
                        <p>For inherited property, <strong>Islamic inheritance rules</strong> determine shares. For
                            jointly purchased property, shares follow the purchase agreement or proportional
                            contribution. The court verifies shares through documentary evidence and commission reports.

                        <h3>What is the court fee for a partition suit in Karachi?</h3>
