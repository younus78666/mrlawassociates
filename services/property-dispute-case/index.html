                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>A property dispute lawyer in Karachi</strong> represents landowners,
                    buyers, tenants, and heirs in legal conflicts over immovable property. MR Law Associates, led by
                    Advocate Reema Jawed, handles land grabbing cases, title fraud, encroachment disputes, tenant
                    eviction petitions, and boundary conflicts before Karachi's Civil Courts, Rent Controller, and the
                    High Court of Sindh. Our firm protects property rights through litigation under the Transfer of
                    Property Act 1882, the Registration Act 1908, and the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005.</p>

                <p>Property disputes are the single most litigated category of civil cases in Karachi. The city's
                    complex land ownership system, involving Sindh Board of Revenue records, SBCA allotments,
                    cooperative society plots, and privately subdivided land, creates frequent ownership conflicts.
                    Fraudulent title deeds, unauthorized construction, and illegal encroachment further complicate
                    matters.</p>

                <h2>What Types of Property Dispute Cases Does MR Law Associates Handle?</h2>

                <p>MR Law Associates handles all categories of property litigation common in Karachi including ownership
                    disputes, boundary conflicts, illegal possession, and rental disagreements. The firm represents both
                    plaintiffs seeking to recover their property rights and defendants protecting their lawful
                    possession.</p>

                            for property fraud, and obtaining urgent injunctions to prevent further encroachment. The

                <h2>How Do You Verify Property Ownership Before Buying in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>Property verification in Karachi requires checking multiple records across different authorities
                    because no single document provides complete ownership proof. A property dispute lawyer conducts a
                    title search covering at least 30 years of ownership history to identify legal risks before
                    purchase.</p>

                <p>The verification process includes:</p>

                <ol style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2.2;">
                    <li><strong>Title deed search:</strong> Verify the registered sale deed (bai-nama) at the
                        Sub-Registrar's office. Confirm the seller's name matches the registered owner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutation records (intiqal):</strong> Check with the Mukhtiarkar (revenue authority) that
                        ownership transfer was properly recorded in the revenue records.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encumbrance certificate:</strong> Obtain from the Sub-Registrar's office confirming no
                        mortgages, liens, or pending litigation exist against the property.</li>
                    <li><strong>SBCA approved plan:</strong> For built properties in Karachi, verify the approved
                        building plan from the Sindh Building Control Authority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utility verification:</strong> Confirm utility connections (electricity, gas, water) are
                        in the seller's name, which corroborates possession.</li>
                    <li><strong>Court case search:</strong> Search Civil Court and High Court records for any pending
                        litigation involving the property or seller.</li>
                    <li><strong>CNIC verification:</strong> Match the seller's CNIC with the owner listed on all
                        documents to prevent impersonation fraud.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Skipping any verification step creates legal risk. Properties bought without proper title search
                    account for a large portion of property dispute cases filed in Karachi's courts. An advocate's title
                    search costs far less than defending a property fraud lawsuit later.</p>

                <h2>What Legal Remedies Exist for Property Disputes in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>Property dispute remedies in Karachi depend on the nature of the conflict and the urgency of relief
                    needed. Courts offer both interim (temporary) and final remedies through different legal instruments
                    under the CPC, Specific Relief Act, and criminal law.</p>

                <h2>What Is Adverse Possession Under Pakistani Property Law?</h2>

                <p>Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to claim ownership of property through
                    continuous, open, hostile, and uninterrupted possession for 12 years without the true owner filing a
                    legal challenge. Under the Limitation Act 1908, if the true owner fails to initiate recovery
                    proceedings within 12 years, the possessor may acquire legal rights over the property.</p>

                <p>Four conditions must be met for an adverse possession claim in Pakistan:</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Continuous possession:</strong> Unbroken physical occupation for a minimum of 12 years.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Open and notorious:</strong> Possession visible and known to the public, not hidden or
                        secret.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hostile to the owner:</strong> Possession without the owner's permission or consent.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exclusive:</strong> The possessor treats the property as their own, not sharing with the
                        true owner.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you suspect someone is building an adverse possession claim against your property, file a <a
                        href="/services/civil-suit/">civil suit</a> immediately. Once the 12-year period expires,
                    recovery becomes substantially more difficult.</p>

                <h2>How Does Tenant Eviction Work Under Sindh Rent Law?</h2>

                <p>Tenant eviction in Karachi follows the procedures of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance 1979.
                    Landlords cannot use force, threats, or utility disconnection to remove tenants. All evictions must
                    go through the Rent Controller's office.</p>

                <p>Legal grounds for eviction include:</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Non-payment of rent:</strong> Tenant has failed to pay rent for 2 or more consecutive
                        months despite written demand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized subletting:</strong> Tenant has sublet the premises without the landlord's
                        written permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Change of use:</strong> Tenant is using the premises for a purpose different from what
                        was agreed (residential converted to commercial).</li>
                    <li><strong>Landlord's personal need:</strong> Landlord requires the premises for their own genuine
                        use (must prove no alternative accommodation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Property damage:</strong> Tenant has caused substantial damage or made unauthorized
                        structural changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuisance:</strong> Tenant's behavior is a nuisance to other occupants or neighbors.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The process starts with a legal notice giving the tenant 15-30 days to comply or vacate. If the
                    tenant doesn't respond, the landlord files an eviction petition before the Rent Controller. The Rent
                    Controller hears both sides and issues an eviction order if grounds are proven.</p>
