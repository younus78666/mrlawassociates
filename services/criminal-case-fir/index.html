                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>A criminal lawyer in Karachi</strong> defends individuals accused of
                    offences under the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 and assists complainants in registering FIRs and
                    prosecuting criminal complaints. MR Law Associates, led by Advocate Reema Jawed, provides criminal
                    defense and prosecution assistance for fraud, theft, assault, cheque dishonor, cybercrime, and

                    Court of Sindh.</p>

                <p>Criminal law in Pakistan operates through a structured system of investigation, prosecution, and
                    trial governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (Cr.P.C.) and the Pakistan Penal Code 1860
                    (PPC). An accused person's rights, including the presumption of innocence and right to <a
                        href="/services/bail-application/">bail</a>, are constitutionally protected. Whether you're
                    filing a complaint or defending against criminal charges, competent legal representation directly
                    impacts the outcome.</p>

                <h2>What Types of Criminal Cases Does MR Law Associates Handle?</h2>

                <p>MR Law Associates handles all categories of criminal matters commonly filed in Karachi courts,
                    covering offences against persons, property, reputation, and commercial fraud. The firm represents
                    both complainants (victims) and accused persons across all criminal court levels.</p>

                <h2>How Does the FIR Registration Process Work in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>FIR (First Information Report) registration is the first step in initiating a criminal case in
                    Pakistan. Under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C., police are legally obligated to register an FIR when
                    informed of a cognizable offence. The FIR creates an official record that triggers police
                    investigation.</p>

                <ol style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2.2;">
                    <li><strong>Approach the police station:</strong> Visit the police station within whose jurisdiction
                        the offence occurred. Bring your CNIC, any evidence (messages, receipts, photos), and details of
                        the incident.</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide information:</strong> The Duty Officer records your statement covering: what
                        happened, when, where, who was involved, and what evidence exists.</li>
                    <li><strong>FIR drafting by Muharrir:</strong> The Muharrir (record clerk) drafts the FIR in Urdu.
                        Your criminal lawyer reviews the draft to ensure correct PPC sections are cited and all relevant
                        facts are included.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signing and copy:</strong> You sign the FIR. Section 154(2) Cr.P.C. entitles you to a
                        free copy. Keep this copy safely; it's the foundation document for your case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> The SHO assigns an Investigating Officer (IO) who collects
                        evidence, records witness statements (Section 161 Cr.P.C.), and arrests suspects if warranted.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Challan submission:</strong> After investigation, the IO submits a challan (police
                        report) to the court under Section 173 Cr.P.C., recommending trial.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What Should You Do If Police Refuse to Register Your FIR?</h2>

                <p>Police refusal to register FIRs is a common problem in Karachi. Despite Section 154 Cr.P.C. making
                    registration mandatory for cognizable offences, some police stations delay or refuse registration.
                    You have three legal remedies available.</p>

                <p>A criminal lawyer drafts these applications with proper legal citations and evidence attachments,
                    significantly increasing the chances of prompt FIR registration. We've handled situations where
                    direct police station visits failed but a well-drafted Section 22-A application succeeded within
                    days.</p>

                <h2>What Are the Stages of a Criminal Case in Pakistan?</h2>

                <p>A criminal case in Pakistan follows a defined procedural sequence from FIR registration through final
                    judgment. Each stage has specific timelines and requirements under the Code of Criminal Procedure
                    1898. Understanding these stages helps you know what to expect at each point in your case.</p>

                <h2>What Is the Difference Between Cognizable and Non-Cognizable Offences?</h2>

                <p>The distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable offences determines how police respond to your
                    complaint. Cognizable offences are serious crimes where police can act immediately. Non-cognizable
                    offences are less serious and require court permission before police involvement.</p>
