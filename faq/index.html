            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Khula procedure in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Khula is a Muslim wife's statutory right to dissolve her marriage through a Family Court without the husband's consent. The wife files a suit under the Family Courts Act 1964, attends a mandatory conciliation hearing, and upon refusing to reconcile, the court grants a dissolution decree within 3 to 6 months. The wife must return her Haq Mehr (dower) as Zar-e-Khula." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How long does a Khula case take in Karachi?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "An uncontested Khula case in Karachi takes 3 to 6 months from filing to decree. Contested cases where the husband disputes terms or delays proceedings take 6 to 18 months. After the court decree, a mandatory 90-day Iddat period follows before the NADRA Divorce Effectiveness Certificate is issued." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can my husband stop me from getting Khula?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "No. A husband cannot legally prevent a wife from obtaining Khula in Pakistan. Under the Family Courts Act 1964 and subsequent amendments, Khula is the wife's absolute right. Even if the husband refuses to appear in court, the judge proceeds ex-parte and dissolves the marriage without his consent." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Do I have to return my Haq Mehr to get Khula?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, generally. Since Khula is wife-initiated, the wife must return received dower or waive unpaid dower as Zar-e-Khula in exchange for dissolution. However, if the husband is at fault (domestic violence, abandonment), courts may grant Khula without requiring full dower return." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Does Khula affect my child custody rights?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Khula strictly dissolves the marital bond and has zero effect on your independent right to seek child custody (Hizanat). Custody is determined separately based on the welfare of the child, not the method of divorce. Mothers retain preferential custody for boys until age 7 and girls until puberty." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What are the legal grounds for Khula in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The primary ground is deep-seated aversion toward the husband. Additional grounds include cruelty, domestic violence, failure to maintain for 2+ years, husband's disappearance for 4+ years, impotence, insanity, and imprisonment for 7+ years under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the difference between Khula and Faskh?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Khula is wife-initiated dissolution where the wife returns her dower in exchange for release. Faskh (judicial divorce) is dissolution on specific fault grounds where the wife retains her dower rights. Khula requires no proof of fault. Faskh requires proving grounds under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the legal procedure for Talaq in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Talaq (husband-initiated divorce) requires the husband to send written notice to the Union Council Chairman and the wife under Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. A mandatory 90-day reconciliation period follows. If reconciliation fails, the divorce becomes effective on the 91st day." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How does a husband legally pronounce Talaq?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The husband must issue a written Talaq notice to the Chairman of the relevant Union Council and send a copy to the wife. Verbal-only Talaq without Union Council notification is not legally effective in Pakistan. The written notice triggers the mandatory 90-day reconciliation process." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Iddat period after Talaq?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Iddat is a mandatory waiting period of 3 menstrual cycles or 3 calendar months after divorce during which the wife cannot remarry. During Iddat, the husband must provide full maintenance including housing, food, clothing, and medical expenses at the same standard as during the marriage." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What role does the Union Council play in divorce?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The Union Council receives the Talaq notice, appoints an Arbitration Council, and attempts reconciliation within 90 days. If reconciliation fails, the divorce becomes effective. The Council then issues the Divorce Effectiveness Certificate required by NADRA to update marital status on the CNIC." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can a Talaq be revoked in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. A single Talaq can be revoked during the 90-day Iddat period through written notice to the Union Council. After the Iddat expires, the Talaq becomes irrevocable. After three separate Talaqs, the couple cannot remarry unless the wife completes Halala (marriage to and divorce from another person)." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What are a wife's financial rights after Talaq?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "After Talaq, the wife is entitled to full Iddat maintenance (3 months), all unpaid Haq Mehr (dower), return of personal dowry articles (Jahez), and child maintenance if she has custody. The husband must also pay outstanding maintenance arrears accumulated during the marriage." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the court marriage procedure in Karachi?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Court marriage in Karachi involves three steps: executing a Free Will Affidavit before a Judicial Magistrate, performing the Nikah ceremony with a registered Qazi in the presence of two witnesses, and registering the marriage with the Union Council for a NADRA Marriage Registration Certificate. The entire process completes in 1 to 2 hours." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a court marriage cost in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A court marriage in Karachi costs between PKR 15,000 to 30,000 including lawyer fees, Magistrate affidavit charges, Nikah Khawan fees, and Union Council registration. NADRA Marriage Registration Certificate processing is an additional PKR 2,000 to 5,000." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What documents are required for a court marriage?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Both parties need original CNICs (or passports if foreign), six passport-sized photographs each, and two adult male witnesses with valid CNICs. If previously married, the original NADRA Divorce Certificate or spouse's Death Certificate is required. Foreigners need a No Impediment to Marriage certificate from their embassy." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the legal age for marriage in Sindh?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The legal minimum age for marriage in Sindh is 18 years for both males and females under the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act 2013. Age must be verified through a NADRA CNIC or B-Form. Any marriage below this age is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment and fine." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Is a court marriage valid for spouse visa applications?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. A court marriage resulting in a registered Nikah Nama and NADRA Computerized Marriage Certificate is fully valid for spouse visa applications worldwide. The certificate can be attested through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) for international recognition." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can parents file an FIR after a court marriage?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Parents sometimes file false kidnapping or Zina FIRs against the groom after a court marriage. However, a Free Will Affidavit executed before a Judicial Magistrate prior to the Nikah legally neutralizes these charges. The lawyer can immediately petition the High Court to quash any false FIR." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Who gets child custody after divorce in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Under Islamic law, mothers have preferential custody (Hizanat) for boys until age 7 and girls until puberty. After these ages, courts apply the welfare of the child test. Fathers retain financial responsibility regardless of custody. Courts consider each parent's capability, moral character, and the child's preference." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Until what age does the mother get custody in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Under Islamic family law applied in Pakistan, the mother has preferential custody for sons until age 7 and daughters until puberty (approximately age 12-14). After these ages, the court determines custody based on the child's best interests and, for older children, the child's own preference." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can a father take custody from the mother?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A father can petition for custody if the mother remarries (this can affect her Hizanat right), if she is found unfit due to proven neglect or moral turpitude, or after the child exceeds the Hizanat age. The court always prioritizes the child's welfare over either parent's claim." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How does a court decide child custody in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Pakistani courts apply the best interest of the child standard under the Guardianship and Wards Act 1890. Factors include the child's age and preference, each parent's financial capability and moral character, living environment stability, educational continuity, and the child's physical and emotional wellbeing." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Hizanat right under Islamic law?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Hizanat is the Islamic legal right of a mother to physical custody of her minor children after divorce. It gives the mother priority custody for boys until age 7 and girls until puberty. Hizanat is distinct from Wilayat (guardianship), which remains with the father even when the mother has physical custody." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can an overseas parent get child custody in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. An overseas parent can file custody proceedings through a Special Power of Attorney holder in Pakistani courts. Courts consider the child's current living situation, the overseas parent's ability to provide, and whether relocation serves the child's welfare. Video testimony may be accepted." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How is wife maintenance calculated in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Courts calculate maintenance based on the husband's income, assets, number of dependents, and the standard of living during marriage. Typical awards range from PKR 15,000-30,000 for incomes of PKR 50,000-100,000, and PKR 30,000-75,000 for incomes of PKR 100,000-300,000. Self-employed husbands may pay 25-35% of net profit." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can a wife claim maintenance during Khula proceedings?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. A wife can claim maintenance for herself during the pendency of Khula proceedings and for her children both during and after Khula. Child maintenance is the father's obligation regardless of the divorce method. The wife's personal maintenance typically ceases after the Khula decree and Iddat period." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the child maintenance obligation of the father?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "The father is legally obligated to provide maintenance for his children regardless of who has custody. This includes food, clothing, housing, education, and healthcare expenses. The obligation continues until sons become self-supporting and daughters until they marry. Courts enforce compliance through salary attachment." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to enforce a maintenance order in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "If the husband fails to pay court-ordered maintenance, the wife can file an execution petition in the Family Court. The court can attach the husband's salary, freeze bank accounts, seize movable property, or even order arrest for willful non-compliance. Employers can be directed to deduct maintenance from salary." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can maintenance arrears be recovered retroactively?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Pakistani courts can award maintenance arrears from the date the husband stopped providing maintenance, not just from the filing date. The wife must prove the period of non-maintenance. Courts calculate the total arrears and may order lump-sum payment or installment recovery." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to file a property dispute case in Karachi?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "File a civil suit in the appropriate Civil Court in Karachi through an advocate. The suit requires a plaint documenting ownership evidence, the nature of dispute, and relief sought. Court fees are calculated under the Court Fees Act 1870. An injunction application can be filed simultaneously for interim protection." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is a stay order in a property dispute?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A stay order is a temporary injunction under Order XXXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 that prevents the opposing party from altering the status quo of disputed property. It can stop construction, prevent sale or transfer, and protect possession rights. Stay orders can be obtained within days of filing." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to recover illegally occupied property in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "File a suit for possession and recovery in the Civil Court with title documents proving ownership. Simultaneously apply for a temporary injunction to prevent further damage. If criminal trespass is involved, file an FIR under Section 447-448 of the Pakistan Penal Code for parallel criminal proceedings." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is a partition suit for inherited property?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A partition suit is filed when co-owners or legal heirs cannot agree on dividing jointly-owned property. The Civil Court determines each party's share under Islamic inheritance law or the Transfer of Property Act, and orders physical division or sale and distribution of proceeds." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How long do property cases take in Karachi courts?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Property dispute cases in Karachi typically take 2 to 5 years for final judgment depending on complexity. However, interim relief such as stay orders and injunctions can be obtained within days to weeks. Simple declaratory suits may conclude in 1 to 2 years." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can overseas Pakistanis file property cases remotely?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Overseas Pakistanis can execute a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) through the Pakistani embassy or consulate in their country, authorizing a lawyer to represent them in court. The SPA holder can file suits, attend hearings, and execute court orders without the owner being physically present." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to file an FIR in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Visit the police station with jurisdiction over where the offense occurred and provide a written or oral complaint to the Station House Officer (SHO). The SHO is legally bound to register an FIR for cognizable offenses under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Bring your CNIC and any evidence." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What should I do if an FIR is registered against me?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Immediately consult a criminal defense lawyer. Do not make statements to police without legal counsel. If the offense is bailable, your lawyer can secure bail from the police station itself. For non-bailable offenses, a bail application must be filed before the court. Avoid fleeing as it worsens your legal position." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the difference between bailable and non-bailable offenses?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Bailable offenses (like minor assault, cheque bounce, defamation) allow bail as a right from the police station or court. Non-bailable offenses (like murder, kidnapping, armed robbery) require a formal bail application before a Magistrate or Sessions Judge, who has discretion to grant or refuse bail." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to get bail in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "For bailable offenses, bail can be obtained at the police station by furnishing surety bonds. For non-bailable offenses, your lawyer files a bail application under Section 497 of the CrPC before the court. Pre-arrest bail (anticipatory bail) can be obtained under Section 498 before arrest occurs." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can I get a false FIR quashed in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. A false FIR can be quashed by filing a petition under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court. You must demonstrate that the FIR is malicious, baseless, or filed with ulterior motives. The High Court can order the FIR cancelled and the investigation stopped." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to get a late birth certificate from NADRA?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A late birth registration requires filing a court application under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act. The court issues an order directing NADRA to register the birth after verifying hospital records, vaccination cards, or school records. Your lawyer files the petition and obtains the court order." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to correct name or date of birth on CNIC?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Minor corrections can be made directly at NADRA offices with supporting documents. For significant changes (name spelling, date of birth), a court order from the Civil Court is required. Your lawyer files a suit for declaration and correction, and the court order directs NADRA to update the record." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to get a NADRA marriage certificate?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "After the Nikah, the Nikah Nama is submitted to the relevant Union Council for registration.

            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to get a death certificate from NADRA?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Report the death to the relevant Union Council within 30 days with the deceased's CNIC, a medical certificate of death, and the informant's CNIC. The Union Council registers the death and NADRA issues a computerized Death Certificate. Late registrations beyond 30 days require a court order." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the process for NADRA document correction through court?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "File a declaratory suit in the Civil Court stating the error in the NADRA record and the correct information. Submit supporting evidence (school records, hospital records, passport). The court issues a decree directing NADRA to correct the record. The entire process takes 3 to 6 months." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to register a company in Pakistan (SECP)?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Company registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) involves name reservation, preparing memorandum and articles of association, filing Form 1 and Form 21 online through the eServices portal, and paying the registration fee. A private limited company can be registered in 3 to 7 business days." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is an NTN and how to register for one?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A National Tax Number (NTN) is a unique tax identification number issued by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to individuals and businesses for tax filing purposes. Registration is done online through the FBR IRIS portal using your CNIC. Processing takes 1 to 3 business days." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How to file income tax return with FBR?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Log into the FBR IRIS portal using your NTN, select the applicable tax year, declare all income sources, claim allowable deductions, calculate tax liability, and submit electronically. The deadline is September 30 each year for salaried individuals. Late filing incurs penalties of PKR 1,000 per month." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the difference between sole proprietorship and private limited?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A sole proprietorship has no separate legal entity, unlimited personal liability, and simpler registration (NTN only). A private limited company is a separate legal entity with limited liability, requires SECP registration, annual audits, and corporate tax filing, but provides credibility and asset protection." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "What are the penalties for not filing tax returns?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Non-filing penalties include PKR 1,000 per month of delay (minimum PKR 10,000), placement on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL) blacklist causing double withholding tax rates on banking transactions, inability to purchase property or vehicles above specified thresholds, and potential prosecution for tax evasion." } },
            { "@type": "Question", "name": "How is property inherited under Islamic law in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Islamic inheritance law in Pakistan distributes the deceased's estate among fixed-share heirs (Quranic shares) including spouse, parents, sons, and daughters. Sons receive double the share of daughters. The estate is distributed after settling debts and funeral expenses. A person can only bequeath up to one-third of their estate by will." } },

            { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can a woman inherit property in Pakistan?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes.

                                <strong>Family Courts Act 1964</strong>, attends a mandatory conciliation hearing, and
                                upon refusing to reconcile, the court grants a dissolution decree within <strong>3 to 6
                                    months</strong>. The wife must return her Haq Mehr (dower) as Zar-e-Khula in
                                exchange for the dissolution.</p>

                                proceedings take <strong>6 to 18 months</strong>. After the court decree, a mandatory

                            <p><strong>No. A husband cannot legally prevent a wife from obtaining Khula in
                                    Pakistan.</strong> Under the <strong>Family Courts Act 1964</strong> and subsequent
                                amendments, Khula is the wife's absolute right. Even if the husband refuses to appear in
                                court, the judge proceeds <strong>ex-parte</strong> and dissolves the marriage without
                                his consent.</p>

                            <p><strong>Yes, generally the wife must return received dower or waive unpaid dower as
                                    Zar-e-Khula.</strong> Since Khula is wife-initiated, compensation to the husband is
                                standard. However, if the husband is at fault (domestic violence, abandonment, failure
                                to maintain), courts may grant Khula <strong>without requiring full dower
                                    return</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>No. Khula strictly dissolves the marital bond and has zero effect on your child
                                    custody rights.</strong> Custody (Hizanat) is determined separately based on the
                                welfare of the child, not the method of divorce. Mothers retain preferential custody for
                                boys until <strong>age 7</strong> and girls until <strong>puberty</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>The primary ground is deep-seated aversion toward the husband, which is

                                violence, failure to maintain for <strong>2+ years</strong>, husband's disappearance for
                                <strong>4+ years</strong>, impotence, insanity, and imprisonment for <strong>7+
