                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>Maintenance litigation in Pakistan</strong> is structurally designed
                    to protect vulnerable spouses and children from financial abandonment. Under the Muslim Family Laws
                    Ordinance 1961, a husband bears the absolute, non-negotiable legal duty to provide adequate
                    maintenance (Nafqa)—encompassing food, clothing, housing, and medical expenses. MR Law Associates
                    prosecutes relentless financial recovery suits in the Karachi Family Courts to secure immediate
                    monthly stipends and claw back years of unpaid arrears.</p>

                <p>When marital harmony breaks down, malicious husbands frequently weaponize their finances, cutting off
                    funding to force wives into accepting harsh <a href="/services/divorce-custody-case/"
                        style="color:var(--accent-gold-dark);">divorce or custody</a> terms. Pakistani law directly
                    counters this financial abuse. Whether you are currently cohabiting with a hostile spouse, living
                    separately due to his cruelty, or enforcing child support post-divorce, the courts possess
                    overwhelming authority to garnish his wages, seize his assets, and even order his civil imprisonment
                    if he attempts to evade payment.</p>

                <h2>Wife Maintenance vs. Child Maintenance</h2>

                <p>It is vital to legally distinguish between the two primary forms of maintenance (Kharcha), as they
                    operate under different statutes and timelines.</p>

                <div class="service-features">
                    <div class="feature-box reveal">
                        <h3>Wife Maintenance (Nafqa-e-Zouja)</h3>
                        <p>A wife is entitled to maintenance as long as the marriage subsists and she fulfills her
                            marital obligations (or is living separately due to the husband's documented cruelty). If
                            divorced, Pakistani law strictly limits her post-marital "alimony" to the duration of her
                            <strong>90-day Iddat period</strong>. After Iddat, the husband's financial obligation to his
                            ex-wife terminates completely.
                        </p>

                    <div class="feature-box reveal">
                        <h3>Child Maintenance (Nafqa-e-Aulad)</h3>
                        <p>Child support is entirely independent of the parents' marital status. A father must provide
                            maintenance for his minor children even if he has divorced the mother and she holds physical
                            <a href="/services/child-custody-lawyer/"
                                style="color:var(--accent-gold-dark);">custody</a>. This obligation extends until a male
                            child reaches puberty (practically 18 years) and a female child is legally married.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>How is the Maintenance Amount Calculated?</h2>

                <p>Unlike Western jurisdictions that rely on rigid percentage calculators, Pakistani Family Courts use
                    judicial discretion based on the "visible status and means" of the father. Husbands routinely
                    attempt to hide their income by submitting fake salary slips or transferring assets to relatives.
                </p>
                <p>Our litigation strategy aggressively pierces this financial veil. We compel the production of
                    authentic bank statements, FBR tax returns, property ownership records, and vehicle registrations.
                    If a husband claims he only earns minimum wage but drives a luxury vehicle and travels
                    internationally, we use Supreme Court precedents to bind the judge to calculate maintenance based on
                    his <strong>demonstrable lifestyle</strong> rather than his fabricated tax declarations.</p>

                <h2>The Chronology of a Maintenance Suit</h2>

                <p>Securing financial decrees requires navigating a structured, multi-tier litigation process inside the
                    Family Courts.</p>

                <h2>Executing the Decree: Forcing Defiant Defendants to Pay</h2>

                <p>Securing a piece of paper declaring you are owed 10 Lakhs in arrears means nothing if the defendant
                    refuses to pay. This is where aggressive Execution falls under our jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>If a father defaults on his child support orders, MR Law Associates utilizes the coercive powers of
                    the Family Court. We execute attachments against his active salary (forcing his corporate employer
                    to route the money directly to the court), freeze his bank accounts (Section 82-A CPC), and place
                    liens against immovable properties. If he still attempts to evade, we issue <strong>Arrest
                        Warrants</strong>, resulting in up to one year of civil imprisonment in Central Jail Karachi
                    until the arrears are cleared.</p>

                        <h3>Does the court factor in inflation?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Standard Family Court decrees in Karachi automatically bake in a
                            <strong>10% annual enhancement</strong>. If the father is ordered to pay Rs. 30,000 this
                            year, it automatically scales to Rs. 33,000 next year without requiring a new lawsuit.

                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 heavily governs maintenance
                    jurisprudence. Decreed amounts are highly subjective, resting entirely upon the presiding judge's
                    interpretation of submitted income evidence and the minor's educational strata. Execution of
                    warrants against defaulting overseas defendants is complex and heavily delayed. MR Law Associates
                    operates exclusively in Karachi, Pakistan.
