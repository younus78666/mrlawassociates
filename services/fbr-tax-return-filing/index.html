                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>FBR tax return filing in Karachi</strong> is the annual process of
                    submitting your income tax return and wealth statement to the Federal Board of Revenue through the
                    IRIS online portal under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001. MR Law Associates handles complete tax
                    return preparation and filing for salaried employees, business owners, freelancers, professionals,
                    partnerships, and companies in Karachi, including income calculation, deduction claims, wealth
                    statement preparation, and post-filing compliance.</p>

                <p>Filing your annual income tax return is not just a legal obligation — it's how you maintain "filer"
                    status with FBR, which saves you significant money on withholding taxes for banking transactions,
                    property purchases, and vehicle registration. MR Law Associates makes the process simple by handling
                    all calculations, documentation, and IRIS portal submission on your behalf.</p>

                <h2>What Types of Tax Returns Does MR Law Associates File?</h2>

                <p>MR Law Associates files all categories of income tax returns recognized by FBR. Each category has
                    different income computation rules, applicable tax rates, and filing deadlines.</p>

                    <li><strong>Information collection:</strong> We request your income documents (salary certificate,

                        submit electronically through the IRIS portal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> FBR issues an electronic acknowledgment receipt. Your name
                        appears on the Active Taxpayer List (ATL), confirming filer status.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What Is the Income Tax Slab in Pakistan?</h2>

                <p>Pakistan uses a progressive tax slab system where higher income attracts higher tax rates. The slabs
                    are updated annually through the Finance Act. Below are the key points about Pakistan's income tax
                    structure.</p>

                <p><em>Note: These are indicative slabs. Actual rates are updated annually through the Finance Act.
                        Contact us for the current year's applicable rates.</em></p>

                <h2>What Is a Wealth Statement and Why Is It Important?</h2>

                <p>A wealth statement is a mandatory annual declaration of all your assets, liabilities, and expenses
                    filed alongside your income tax return. FBR uses the wealth statement to verify that your asset
                    accumulation is consistent with your declared income over the years.</p>

                <p>The wealth statement includes:</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Assets:</strong> All property owned (land, houses, apartments), vehicles, bank balances
                        in all accounts, investments (savings certificates, mutual funds, shares), cash in hand, and
                        personal effects of significant value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> All loans (bank, personal, mortgage), credit card outstanding, and
                        any debts owed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal expenses:</strong> Estimated household expenditure, education costs, rent,
                        utilities, and other significant expenses during the year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconciliation:</strong> Opening wealth + income − expenses = closing wealth. Any
                        discrepancy is flagged by FBR for explanation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Are the Penalties for Late or Non-Filing?</h2>

                <p>FBR enforces penalties for taxpayers who miss filing deadlines or fail to file entirely. The
                    financial consequences of non-compliance can be significant.</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Late filing penalty:</strong> Under Section 182, a minimum penalty of Rs. 40,000 for
                        individuals or 0.1% of tax payable per day of delay, whichever is higher.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-filer status:</strong> Your name is removed from the Active Taxpayer List, resulting
                        in double withholding taxes on all transactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>FBR notices:</strong> Non-filers receive notices under Section 114 demanding returns.
                        Failure to comply leads to further penalties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prosecution:</strong> In serious cases of tax evasion, FBR can initiate criminal
                        proceedings resulting in imprisonment and fines.</li>
                </ul>
