                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>Company registration in Karachi</strong> is the legal process of
                    incorporating a business entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) under
                    the Companies Act 2017. MR Law Associates handles end-to-end company registration including name
                    reservation, Memorandum and Articles of Association drafting, SECP filing, digital certificate
                    issuance, <a href="/services/ntn-registration/">NTN registration</a>, and post-incorporation
                    compliance for Private Limited Companies, Single Member Companies, LLPs, and NGOs in Karachi.</p>

                <p>Registering a company provides legal liability protection, credibility with banks and clients, tax
                    benefits, and access to government contracts. Whether you're a startup founder, professional
                    partnership, or foreign investor setting up in Pakistan, proper company registration through SECP is
                    the foundation of legal business operations.</p>

                <h2>What Types of Companies Can Be Registered in Pakistan?</h2>

                <p>Pakistan's Companies Act 2017 provides several entity types, each suited to different business sizes,
                    ownership structures, and objectives. The choice of entity affects your liability exposure, tax
                    obligations, and compliance requirements.</p>

                    <div class="feature-box reveal">
                        <h3>Private Limited Company (Pvt. Ltd.)</h3>

                <h2>How Does the Company Registration Process Work in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>Company registration in Pakistan is processed through SECP's eServices portal. The process is
                    digital, but requires proper legal documentation. MR Law Associates handles every step from name
                    reservation through post-incorporation setup.</p>

                <ol style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2.2;">
                    <li><strong>Entity type selection:</strong> We advise on the best entity type (Pvt. Ltd., SMC, LLP,
                        NPO) based on your business objectives, ownership structure, and tax considerations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Name reservation:</strong> We propose and reserve your company name through SECP's
                        eServices. Names must be unique, not misleading, and comply with SECP naming regulations. We
                        suggest 3 alternatives in case the primary name is rejected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document preparation:</strong> We draft the Memorandum of Association (company
                        objectives and powers), Articles of Association (internal governance rules), and required SECP
                        forms (Forms 1, 21, 29).</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital signatures:</strong> Directors obtain digital signatures from SECP-approved
                        certification authorities. These are required for electronic filing.</li>
                    <li><strong>SECP filing:</strong> All documents, forms, and fee payments are submitted through
                        SECP's eServices portal.</li>
                    <li><strong>SECP review:</strong> SECP reviews the application (5-14 working days). They may raise
                        queries or request name changes. We handle all correspondence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorporation certificate:</strong> SECP issues the Certificate of Incorporation. Your
                        company is now a legal entity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-incorporation:</strong> <a href="/services/ntn-registration/"
                            style="color:var(--accent-gold-dark);">NTN registration</a> with FBR, company bank account
                        opening, and commencement of business certificate (for Pvt. Ltd.).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Private Limited vs. LLP: Which Should You Choose?</h2>

                <p>This is the most common decision point for businesses registering in Pakistan. Both provide limited
                    liability, but differ in governance, compliance, and flexibility.</p>
