                <p class="speakable-answer"><strong>A marriage certificate in Karachi</strong> is obtained through a
                    two-step process: registering the nikah (Islamic marriage contract) with the Union Council and then
                    obtaining a computerized marriage certificate from NADRA. MR Law Associates handles complete
                    marriage documentation services including nikah nama registration, NADRA certificate applications,
                    court marriage proceedings, marriage certificate attestation for foreign use, and spouse visa
                    documentation for overseas immigration.</p>

                <p>A legally valid marriage in Pakistan requires proper registration. Without a registered nikah nama
                    and NADRA marriage certificate, complications arise in CNIC updates, passport applications, visa
                    processing, property registration, and <a href="/services/divorce-custody-case/">divorce
                        proceedings</a>. Many couples discover documentation gaps years after marriage when they need
                    certificates for immigration or legal matters.</p>

                <h2>How Does Marriage Registration Work in Karachi?</h2>

                <p>Marriage registration in Pakistan follows a defined legal process under the Muslim Family Laws
                    Ordinance 1961 and the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act. The process involves two
                    stages: nikah registration with the Union Council and NADRA certificate issuance.</p>

                <ol style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2.2;">
                    <li><strong>Nikah ceremony:</strong> The nikah is performed by a licensed nikah khwan (marriage
                        registrar) in the presence of two male witnesses or one male and two female witnesses. Both
                        bride and groom (or their wakeel) provide consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nikah nama signing:</strong> The nikah nama (marriage contract) is signed by both
                        parties, witnesses, and the nikah khwan. It specifies haq mehr (dower) amount, conditions, and
                        special stipulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Union Council registration:</strong> The nikah khwan submits the nikah nama to the local
                        Union Council within 7 days. The Union Council issues a certified registered nikah nama.</li>
                    <li><strong>CNIC update:</strong> Both spouses visit NADRA to update their CNICs with spouse details
                        (marital status change from single to married).</li>
                    <li><strong>Marriage certificate:</strong> NADRA issues a computerized marriage certificate based on
                        the registered nikah nama and updated CNIC records.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What Is a Court Marriage and When Is It Needed?</h2>

                <p>A court marriage is performed before a Magistrate or civil authority and provides immediate legal
                    recognition. Court marriages are used in specific situations where a traditional nikah ceremony is
                    not feasible or where additional legal protection is needed.</p>

                <p>Common situations requiring court marriage:</p>

                <ul style="color:var(--text-secondary); padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
                    <li><strong>Family opposition:</strong> When families do not consent to the marriage. Pakistani law
                        allows adults (18+) to marry without family consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inter-sect marriage:</strong> Marriages between different Islamic sects where getting a
                        nikah khwan from one sect may cause issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate legal documentation:</strong> When an officially recognized certificate is
                        needed urgently for travel, visa, or other purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second marriage:</strong> When a husband is contracting a second marriage (requiring
                        Union Council permission under Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance).</li>
                </ul>
