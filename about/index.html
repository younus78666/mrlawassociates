                <!-- Advocate Tier Explanation -->
                <h2>What Differentiates an Advocate High Court?</h2>
                <p class="about-section-subtitle">Understanding Pakistan's judicial licensing tiers is critical when
                    selecting legal representation for high-stakes litigation or significant financial disputes.</p>

                        <h3>Advocate (Lower Courts)</h3>
                        <p>An attorney licensed strictly to practice in the District Courts (Civil Courts, Sessions
                            Courts, Magistrate Courts). While competent for initial trials, they cannot represent clients
                            in appellate actions or file constitutional writ petitions if the case escalates beyond the
                            district level.</p>

                                Designation)</span></h3>
                        <p>A senior licensing tier achieved after completing requisite years of verified lower court
                            practice. An Advocate High Court commands jurisdiction to argue appeals directly before the
                            High Court of Sindh, challenge adverse lower court judgments, and file constitutional
                            petitions against unlawful government actions or police harassment.</p>

                            permitting appearances before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Islamabad. High Court
                            Advocates frequently brief Supreme Court counsel on cases escalating to the final appellate
                            tier.</p>
